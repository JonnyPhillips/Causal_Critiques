# Morning

1. Introduction to the Course
2. [Lecture Slides](https://jonnyphillips.github.io/Causal_Critiques/Day 1/Slides_Day_2_v2.pdf)

## Afternoon

Based on [this research paper](https://jonnyphillips.github.io/Causal_Critiques/Day 4/Boas and Hidalgo airwaves.pdf), the Ministry of Communications has proposed to ban all politicians from owning radio licences. Your task is to write a report for the Ministry: Should this ban go ahead? Does the evidence from Boas and Hidalgo provide strong justification for this ban? What do we learn and what do we *not* learn from their research?
