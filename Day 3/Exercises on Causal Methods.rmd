The following are observational studies that have been conducted by political scientists. Propose an alternative methodology that might support a more convincing causal argument in each context, and list the assumptions required for the methodology to be successful:

1. Areas where land rights are distributed by politicians have more violence.

2. Voters with more information about politicians' performance are more likely to reward good governance.

3. Municipalities with biometric voting have highter turnout.

4. Receiving government news broadcasts makes you more trusting in government.

5. Natural resource revenues discourage investments in education.

6. Reforming the police can reduce violence.
